# Interface Segregation

The interface-segregation principle (ISP) states that no class, function, method etc should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

Large interfaces should be break down into chunks of small interfaces.

Similar to the Single Responsibility Principle, the goal of the Interface Segregation Principle is to reduce the side effects and frequency of required changes by splitting the software into multiple, independent parts.
