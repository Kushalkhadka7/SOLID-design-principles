# SOLID-design-principles

SOLID is a popular set of design principles that are used in object-oriented software development. SOLID is an acronym that stands for five key design principles: single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle, and dependency inversion principle. All five are commonly used by software engineers and provide some important benefits for developers.

The broad goal of the SOLID principles is to reduce dependencies so that engineers change one area of software without impacting others. Additionally, theyâ€™re intended to make designs easier to understand, maintain, and extend. Ultimately, using these design principles makes it easier for software engineers to avoid issues and to build adaptive, effective, and agile software.
